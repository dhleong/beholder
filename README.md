## What?

Beholder provides an ultra-fast, "fuzzy" search interface to just about anything
in 5th edition D&D. It is meant as a quick reference for players, game masters,
and maybe even fans watching a [podcast][1]. It is not intended to be a replacement
for the Player's Handbook or Dungeon Master's Guide, and as such there's not really
a "browse" feature. Instead, it is intended to augment the official materials,
providing a quick and easy way to look up the specifics of a monster, spell, class
feature, or other "thing" in the D&D universe.

## How?

Precompiled builds are provided for the [latest release][2].

Beholder is written in [Go][3], so you can also `go get` it:

    go get -u github.com/dhleong/beholder

On macOS you can install it via [homebrew][4]:

    brew install dhleong/tap/beholder
